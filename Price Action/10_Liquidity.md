# Liquidity

## Introduction
Liquidity forms the cornerstone of Inner Circle Trading (ICT) and Smart Money Concepts (SMC) methodologies. Understanding liquidity levels helps traders identify potential market reversals and strategic entry/exit points by recognizing where significant order clusters exist.

## Definition
Liquidity in trading refers to concentrated areas of stop loss orders that can trigger significant market movements. It comes in two primary forms:
- **Buyside Liquidity (BSL)**: Clusters of buy stop orders from short sellers
- **Sellside Liquidity (SSL)**: Clusters of sell stop orders from long position holders

## Types of Liquidity

### Buyside Liquidity (BSL)
1. Definition:
   - Price levels with concentrated pending buy orders
   - Primarily stop loss orders from short sellers
   - Located above key market levels

2. Characteristics:
   - Triggers short position closures
   - Can lead to market reversals
   - Often found above significant highs

### Sellside Liquidity (SSL)
1. Definition:
   - Price levels with concentrated pending sell orders
   - Primarily stop loss orders from long position holders
   - Located below key market levels
