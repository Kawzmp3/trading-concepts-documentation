# Change In State of Delivery (CISD)

## Introduction
A Change In State of Delivery (CISD) is a sophisticated trading concept employed by price action traders (also known as SMC or ICT Traders). This pattern identifies sudden momentum shifts that signal potential market reversals, providing traders with early entry opportunities in emerging trends.

## Definition
A Change In State of Delivery (CISD) occurs when there is a sudden momentum shift from bullish to bearish, or vice versa, signaling a potential market reversal. It represents a reversal trading pattern where price's momentum shifts abruptly, focusing on key levels where price sweeps liquidity before sharply reversing direction.

Types of CISD:
- **Bullish CISD**: Indicates a shift from bearish to bullish momentum, leading to price increases
- **Bearish CISD**: Indicates a shift from bullish to bearish momentum, leading to price decreases
