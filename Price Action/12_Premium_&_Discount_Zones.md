# Premium & Discount Zones

## Introduction
Premium & Discount Zones represent a fundamental trading concept utilized by price action traders (SMC and ICT practitioners) to identify optimal price levels for entries and exits. These zones help traders determine whether an asset is trading above, below, or at its fair value.

## Core Concepts

### Basic Understanding
1. Premium Definition:
   - Price higher than perceived value
   - Similar to everyday premium pricing
   - Example: Concert tickets above face value

2. Discount Definition:
   - Price lower than perceived value
   - Similar to everyday discounts
   - Example: Seasonal sales pricing

## Trading Application

### Market Context
1. Premium in Trading:
   - Asset priced above intrinsic value
   - Often due to market speculation
   - Result of strong buying pressure

2. Discount in Trading:
   - Asset priced below intrinsic value
   - Often due to market undervaluation
   - Opportunity for value buying

## Identification Method

### Technical Analysis Approach
1. Fibonacci Retracement Setup:
   - Configure tool settings:
     * Disable all lines except 0, 0.5, and 1
     * Anchor from swing low to swing high
   
2. Zone Definition:
   - Discount Zone: 0-0.5 Fibonacci range
   - Premium Zone: 0.5-1 Fibonacci range
