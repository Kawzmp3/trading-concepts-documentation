# SMT Divergences

## Introduction
SMT Divergences are a sophisticated trading concept utilized by price action traders (also known as SMC or ICT traders). These divergences represent price discrepancies between two correlated assets, offering traders opportunities to identify potential market reversals and profit from market imbalances.

## Definition
SMT Divergences are areas where the prices of two correlated assets don't follow each other. These divergences can be an indication of a market reversal or shift in market sentiment. While traditional divergences compare price movement with indicators (like RSI or MACD), SMT Divergences focus on the relationship between two correlated assets.

## Market Correlations

### Positive Correlation
- Assets move in the same direction
- Influenced by similar economic factors
- Common in same industry sectors

Examples:
1. JP Morgan Chase ($JPM) and Bank of America ($BAC)
   - Both are large financial institutions
   - Stock prices move in sync
   - Affected by interest rates, regulations, economic growth

2. ExxonMobil ($XOM) and Chevron ($CVX)
   - Both are energy sector giants
   - Move together due to oil prices
   - Affected by geopolitical events and energy market trends

### Negative Correlation
- Assets move in opposite directions
- Respond differently to economic conditions
- Often seen between competing sectors

Examples:
1. Gold ($XAUUSD) and U.S. Dollar ($DXY)
   - Inverse relationship
   - Dollar strength affects gold prices
   - International investment dynamics

2. Oil ($CL) and American Airlines ETF ($JETS)
   - Higher oil prices impact airline costs
   - Inverse relationship due to fuel expenses
   - Industry-specific dynamics

### No Correlation
- Assets move independently
- No consistent relationship
- Influenced by different factors

## Identification Methods

### Bullish SMT Divergence
1. Pattern Formation:
   - Asset 1 ($ES): Forms Low (L) → High (H) → Lower Low (LL) → Higher High (HH)
   - Asset 2 ($YM): Forms Low → High → Higher Low (HL) → Higher High
   - Divergence identified when second asset fails to make Lower Low

2. Drawing the Divergence:
   - Connect Low to Lower Low on first asset
   - Connect Low to Higher Low on second asset

### Bearish SMT Divergence
1. Pattern Formation:
   - Asset 1 ($ES): Forms High → Low → Higher High → Lower Low
   - Asset 2 ($YM): Forms High → Low → Lower High (LH) → Lower Low
   - Divergence identified when second asset fails to make Higher High

2. Drawing the Divergence:
   - Connect High to Higher High on first asset
   - Connect High to Lower High on second asset

## Trading Applications

### Long Trade Strategy
1. Setup Components:
   - Identify bullish SMT Divergence
   - Wait for additional confluence (e.g., bullish FVG)
   - Look for price retracement

2. Trade Execution:
   - Enter at key level (e.g., FVG retest)
   - Set stop loss below zone
   - Target 1:3 risk-to-reward ratio

### Short Trade Strategy
1. Setup Components:
   - Identify bearish SMT Divergence
   - Wait for additional confluence (e.g., bearish Order Block)
   - Look for price retracement

2. Trade Execution:
   - Enter at key level (e.g., Order Block retest)
   - Set stop loss above zone
   - Target 1:3 risk-to-reward ratio

## Best Practices

### Timeframe Selection
- Works on all timeframes
- Suitable for scalping, day trading, and swing trading

### Implementation Guidelines
1. Never trade SMT Divergences alone
2. Use as confluence with other technical tools
