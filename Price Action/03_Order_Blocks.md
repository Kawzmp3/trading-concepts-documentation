# Order Blocks (OB)

## Introduction
Order Blocks (OB) represent a fundamental concept in price action trading, particularly utilized by SMC (Smart Money Concepts) and ICT (Inner Circle Trader) practitioners. These powerful tools help traders identify areas of significant buying or selling pressure on charts, creating opportunities for profitable trades.

## Definition
Order Blocks are specific chart areas containing a substantial concentration of limit orders that trigger notable market reactions when price revisits these zones. They come in two varieties:
- **Bullish Order Block**: Indicates a concentration of limit buy orders
- **Bearish Order Block**: Indicates a concentration of limit sell orders

## Market Context
Order Blocks form during specific market conditions that follow a particular sequence:
1. Initial Consolidation Phase: Market in equilibrium
2. Sudden Impulse Move: Breaking of equilibrium
3. Formation of the Order Block: Last opposing candle before the impulse

## Identification Method

### General Pattern Recognition
1. Look for a consolidating market (equilibrium phase)
2. Identify an impulsive move following the consolidation
3. Locate the last opposing candle before the impulse
4. Mark the Order Block zone using this candle

### Bullish Order Block Identification
1. Find an area of consolidation on your chart
2. Look for a large bullish movement following the consolidation
3. Identify the last bearish candle before the impulsive move
4. Draw the Order Block zone:
   - Upper boundary: High of the bearish candle
   - Lower boundary: Low of the bearish candle

### Bearish Order Block Identification
1. Find an area of consolidation on your chart
2. Look for a large bearish movement following the consolidation
3. Identify the last bullish candle before the impulsive move
4. Draw the Order Block zone:
   - Upper boundary: High of the bullish candle
   - Lower boundary: Low of the bullish candle

## Trading Strategy

### Directional Bias
- Trade WITH the Order Block's direction, never against it
- For Bullish OB: Look for LONG opportunities only
- For Bearish OB: Look for SHORT opportunities only

### Example Trade Setup
1. Wait for price to retest the Order Block
2. Look for confirmation signals (e.g., bearish 9/21 EMA crossover)
3. Enter trade in the direction of the Order Block
4. Set stop loss above/below the Order Block
5. Target minimum 1:1.5 risk-to-reward ratio
