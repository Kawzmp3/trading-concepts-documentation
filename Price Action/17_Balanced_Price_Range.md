# Balanced Price Range (BPR)

## Introduction
A Balanced Price Range (BPR) is a sophisticated trading concept utilized by price action traders (also known as SMC or ICT Traders). It represents an overlapping area between two Fair Value Gaps (FVGs), providing traders with high-probability entry points during market pullbacks.

## Definition
A Balanced Price Range is an overlapping area between two Fair Value Gaps (FVGs). These areas represent where market imbalances, created by rapid price moves, become balanced through the overlapping of opposite FVGs. BPRs often attract significant market activity, making them valuable zones for:
- Market reversals
- Trend continuations
- Potential breakouts

Types of BPR:
- **Bullish BPR**: Used for long trade entry opportunities
- **Bearish BPR**: Used for short trade entry opportunities

## Pattern Recognition

### Bullish BPR Identification
1. Key Components:
   - Identify a bullish FVG
   - Look for overlapping bearish FVG
   - Mark the overlapping area as BPR

2. Characteristics:
   - Forms during uptrends
   - Often found in discount zones
   - Provides potential long entry points

### Bearish BPR Identification
1. Key Components:
   - Identify a bearish FVG
   - Look for overlapping bullish FVG
   - Mark the overlapping area as BPR

2. Characteristics:
   - Forms during downtrends
   - Often found in premium zones
   - Provides potential short entry points

## Trading Applications

### Long Trade Strategy

   - Identify bullish BPR
   - Confirm location within discount zone
   - Wait for price retracement

   - Set stop loss above BPR
   - Target 1:2 risk-to-reward ratio

## Key Differences: BPR vs. IFVG

### BPR Characteristics
- Forms from overlapping opposite FVGs
- Requires two FVGs
- Can be considered as an IFVG
- Creates balanced price zones

### IFVG Characteristics
- Forms when FVG is invalidated
- Requires single FVG invalidation
- Not always a BPR
- Created by price invalidation

## Best Practices

### Timeframe Selection
- Works effectively on all timeframes
- Recommended approach:
  * Use higher timeframe analysis
  * Avoid trading against market trend
