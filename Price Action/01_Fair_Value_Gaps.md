# Fair Value Gaps (FVG)

## Introduction
In the trading of stocks and currencies, the use of fair value gaps in trading strategies has recently grown. Fair value gaps are a price action concept popularized by the ICT (Inner Circle Trader). They locate areas of imbalance on a chart where traders can enter positions to profit.

## Definition
A Fair Value Gap (FVG) on a chart identifies an area where the fair price of an asset has recently changed. This change implies that when the price returns to where the FVG had just formed, it will either rise if it is a bullish FVG or fall if it is a bearish FVG. This concept is similar to that of supply and demand zones or support and resistance lines; however, FVG's form faster, giving those traders using them an advantage.

## Key Characteristics
- Forms during strong directional moves
- Similar to supply and demand zones but forms faster
- Represents areas of price imbalance
- Can be both bullish (upward) and bearish (downward)
- Often serves as a magnet for price to return
- Best used on intraday timeframes
- Works best with high volume securities
- Forms more quickly than other signals but can be less accurate

## Identification Method
FVGs are identified using a three-candle pattern. Look for a candle that is large relative to the candle on its left and right.

### Bullish FVG
1. Identify a green candle that is large relative to the candles on its left and right
2. The high value of the candle on the left (1) should not overlap with the low value of the candle on the right (2)
3. Draw a box where:
   - Bottom = left candle's high (4)
   - Top = right candle's low (3)
   - Extend the box out to the most recent candles
4. When price falls into this zone, it's likely to reverse and rise again
5. Invalid if price falls below the zone's bottom

### Bearish FVG
1. Identify a red candle that is large relative to the candles on its right and left
2. The low of the left candle should not overlap with the high of the right candle
3. Draw a box where:
   - Top = left candle's low
   - Bottom = right candle's high
   - Extend the box to recent candles
4. When price rises into this zone, it's likely to reverse and fall
5. Invalid if price rises above the zone's top

## Theory Behind FVGs
- Large price spikes typically represent large buy orders being executed
- This spike enables position holders to exit for profit at higher prices
- When prices don't retrace after a spike but continue higher:
  - Indicates holders believe the new price level is justified
  - Suggests a shift in fair value perception
  - Creates a new trading range

### Example Scenario
- Initial scenario: Stock trading between $9-$10
- Trigger event: News causes spike to $11
- Holder behavior: Maintain positions, believing in further increase
- Value shift: Fair value shifts from $9-$10 to $10-$11
- Future behavior: Retracements to $10-$11 likely to find buyers

### Validation/Invalidation
- The first high of the left candle represents the bottom of the new fair value
- The right candle represents the high of the new fair value
- If the low of the last candle overlaps the high of the first:
  - Indicates sufficient selling pressure
  - Shows insufficient confidence in new value level
  - Invalidates the FVG

## Best Practices
1. Timeframes
   - Best on intraday timeframes (3min, 5min, 15min)
   - Less than one day timeframes preferred
   - Focus on shorter timeframes for more opportunities

2. Securities
   - Best with high trading volume stocks
   - Applicable to cryptocurrencies and futures
   - Any liquid market with sufficient volume
   - Higher volume means better reliability

## Trading Applications
1. Mean Reversion
   - Trading the fill of the gap
   - Using the gap as a target area

2. Trend Continuation
   - Using filled gaps as support/resistance
   - Entry confirmation after gap fill

3. Market Structure
   - Identifying strong moves
   - Determining potential reversal points

## Common Mistakes
1. Not considering market context
2. Trading every gap without validation
3. Ignoring volume and liquidity
4. Not waiting for confirmation
5. Using inappropriate timeframes
6. Trading low volume securities
7. Not respecting invalidation levels

- ICT (Inner Circle Trader) materials
- Trading studies on gap fill probability
- Volume analysis resources
- Market structure education

## Accuracy Considerations
Fair value gaps are identified using a three-candle pattern, which means they:
- Form more quickly than other signals
- Can be less accurate than longer-term patterns
- Require validation through other technical tools
- Work best when combined with other forms of analysis
