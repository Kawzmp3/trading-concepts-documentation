# Breaker Blocks (BB)

## Introduction
Breaker Blocks (BB) are an advanced trading concept utilized by price action traders, particularly in SMC (Smart Money Concepts) and ICT (Inner Circle Trader) methodologies. These formations help traders identify potential reversal zones and profitable entry points by understanding the transformation of invalidated order blocks.

## Definition
A Breaker Block (BB) is created when an Order Block (OB) is invalidated, functioning similarly to how broken resistance levels become support. They come in two varieties:
- **Bullish Breaker Block**: Forms when a bearish Order Block is invalidated
- **Bearish Breaker Block**: Forms when a bullish Order Block is invalidated

## Key Concepts

### Relationship with Order Blocks
1. Breaker Blocks are directly derived from Order Blocks
2. Understanding Order Blocks is essential for identifying Breaker Blocks
3. The invalidation process transforms the original Order Block's polarity

### Formation Process
1. Initial Order Block Formation
2. Price Movement Against the Order Block
3. Invalidation of the Order Block
4. Transformation into a Breaker Block

## Identification Method

### General Requirements
1. Locate an existing Order Block
2. Monitor for invalidation criteria:
   - Option 1: Candle wick breaching the zone boundary
   - Option 2: Candle close beyond the zone boundary

### Bullish Breaker Block Identification
1. Find a bearish Order Block
2. Wait for invalidation:
   - Candle close above the zone OR
   - Wick penetration above the zone
3. Zone transforms into a bullish Breaker Block
4. Look for long trade opportunities on retests

### Bearish Breaker Block Identification
1. Find a bullish Order Block
2. Wait for invalidation:
   - Candle close below the zone OR
   - Wick penetration below the zone
3. Zone transforms into a bearish Breaker Block
4. Look for short trade opportunities on retests

## Trading Strategy

### Directional Bias
- Trade WITH the Breaker Block's direction
- Bullish BB: Look for LONG opportunities only
- Bearish BB: Look for SHORT opportunities only

### Long Trade Setup Example
1. Initial Formation:
   - Identify bearish Order Block
   - Wait for downward price movement
   - Look for bullish liquidity grab
2. Invalidation:
   - Bullish candle closes above Order Block
   - Zone becomes bullish Breaker Block
3. Trade Execution:
   - Wait for price retest
   - Set stop loss below zone
   - Target 1:2 risk-to-reward ratio

### Short Trade Setup Example
1. Initial Formation:
   - Identify bullish Order Block
   - Wait for upward price movement
   - Look for bearish liquidity grab
2. Invalidation:
   - Bearish candle closes below Order Block
   - Zone becomes bearish Breaker Block
3. Trade Execution:
   - Wait for price retest
   - Set stop loss above zone
   - Target 1:2 risk-to-reward ratio

### Key Differences from Order Blocks

   - Order Blocks: Form at swing points after quick reversals
   - Breaker Blocks: Form after Order Block invalidation
2. Market Context:
   - Order Blocks: Initial areas of buyer/seller activity
   - Breaker Blocks: Transformed zones after polarity change

## Risk Management
1. Place stops beyond the Breaker Block boundaries
2. Maintain minimum 1:2 risk-to-reward ratio
3. Wait for clear retests of the zone
