# Equal Highs (EQH)

## Introduction
Equal Highs (EQH) is a significant price action concept utilized by SMC (Smart Money Concepts) and ICT traders to identify potential bearish reversals or consolidation areas in the market. This pattern serves as a valuable tool for confirming trend changes and establishing trading bias.

## Definition
An Equal High (EQH) is a technical pattern that occurs when price retests and rejects a previous swing high level. This formation serves as a bearish indication, suggesting potential trend reversal or continued consolidation.

## Pattern Recognition

### Key Components
1. Initial Swing High:
   - Must be a clear market peak
   - Higher than surrounding price action

2. Retest Characteristics:
   - Price returns to initial swing high
   - Retest candle must be lower than original swing high
   - Rejection from the level must be visible

### Identification Process
1. Locate significant swing high
2. Monitor for price return to that level
3. Confirm rejection from the level
4. Verify retest candle height relative to original swing

## Trading Applications

### Primary Function
- NOT used for direct entry/exit signals
- Serves as trend reversal confirmation
- Helps establish bearish market bias
- Guides trade direction selection

### Trading Bias
1. Formation Implications:
   - Indicates potential bearish reversal
   - Suggests resistance level strength
   - Helps identify market structure shifts

2. Strategy Development:

### Common Trading Strategy

#### Integration with Other Concepts
1. Combination with Order Blocks:
   - Use EQH for trend bias confirmation
   - Look for bearish Fair Value Gaps (FVG)
   - Enter on FVG retests

2. Trade Management:
   - Entry: After EQH confirmation with FVG retest
   - Stop Loss: Above key resistance levels
   - Take Profit: At significant support levels:
     * Bullish order blocks
     * Support zones
     * Buy-side liquidity areas

## Best Practices

### Timeframe Selection
1. Flexible Application:
   - Day Trading: 1-15 minute charts
   - Swing Trading: Hourly/Daily charts
   - Long-term: Higher timeframes

2. Considerations:
   - Higher timeframes provide more reliable signals
   - Lower timeframes offer more opportunities
   - Reduced noise in longer timeframes
   - Match timeframe to trading style

### Pattern Reliability
1. Confluence Factors:
   - Combine with other bearish indicators:
     * Bearish Fair Value Gaps
     * Bearish Order Blocks
     * Supply Zones

   - Consider market context

2. Signal Strength:
   - More reliable with multiple confirmations
   - Stronger on higher timeframes

## Risk Management

### Entry Considerations
1. Multiple Confirmation Requirement:
   - Never trade EQH in isolation
   - Wait for additional confluence
   - Verify market context

2. Position Sizing:
   - Based on risk tolerance
   - Account for stop loss distance
   - Consider market volatility

### Exit Strategy
1. Profit Targets:
   - Key support levels
   - Bullish order blocks
   - Buy-side liquidity zones

2. Stop Loss Placement:
   - Above resistance levels
