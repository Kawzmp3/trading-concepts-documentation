# Liquidity Grabs

## Introduction
Liquidity Grabs are a sophisticated price action concept used by SMC (Smart Money Concepts) and ICT traders to identify potential market reversals. These formations occur when significant liquidity levels are swept, triggering mass position closures and potentially indicating trend changes.

## Definition
A Liquidity Grab represents a specific market pattern where a large number of buy or sell orders are triggered at key levels. They come in two varieties:
- **Bullish Liquidity Grab**: Indicates triggered buy orders and potential upward trend
- **Bearish Liquidity Grab**: Indicates triggered sell orders and potential downward trend

## Pattern Recognition

### Key Components
1. Candle Characteristics:
   - Large wick
   - Small body
   - Quick price rejection
   - Similar to Doji patterns

2. Level Interaction:
   - Price approaches key level
   - Swift penetration
   - Rapid reversal
   - Clear rejection

### Bullish Liquidity Grab Identification
1. Prerequisites:
   - Identify Sellside Liquidity (SSL) levels
   - Monitor price approach to SSL

2. Formation Pattern:
   - Price moves below SSL level
   - Quick upward rejection
   - Long bottom wick
   - Thin candle body
   - Similar to Dragonfly Doji

3. Confirmation:
   - Candle closes above SSL
   - Strong buying pressure evident
   - Clear rejection of lower prices

### Bearish Liquidity Grab Identification
1. Prerequisites:
   - Identify Buyside Liquidity (BSL) levels
   - Monitor price approach to BSL

2. Formation Pattern:
   - Price moves above BSL level
   - Quick downward rejection
   - Long top wick
   - Thin candle body
   - Similar to Gravestone Doji

3. Confirmation:
   - Candle closes below BSL
   - Strong selling pressure evident
   - Clear rejection of higher prices

## Trading Applications
