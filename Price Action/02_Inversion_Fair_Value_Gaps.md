# Inversion Fair Value Gaps (IFVG)

## Introduction
An Inversion Fair Value Gap (IFVG) is a trading concept used by price action traders (also known as SMC or ICT traders). An IFVG can be used as an indication of a price reversal, or as an area for taking trade entries or profits in an open trade. A bullish IFVG will be used to take long entries, while a bearish IFVG will be used to take short entries.

## Definition
An inversion fair value gap is formed when a fair value gap is invalidated, by a candle wick or close. These areas can indicate a shift in the market's momentum, indicating a potential reversal in the market's trend.

**Note**: Understanding Fair Value Gaps (FVG) is critical before learning about IFVGs, as IFVGs are based on FVG invalidation.

## Identification Method
### Bullish IFVG
1. Locate a bearish Fair Value Gap (FVG)
2. Wait for the FVG to be invalidated or broken by:
   - A candle wick, or
   - A candle close
3. Once invalidated, it becomes a bullish IFVG
4. Use the zone for potential long trade entries
5. Invalidation: If price rises past the bottom of the bullish IFVG zone

### Bearish IFVG
1. Locate a bullish Fair Value Gap (FVG)
2. Wait for the FVG to be invalidated or broken by:
   - A candle wick, or
   - A candle close
3. Once invalidated, it becomes a bearish IFVG
4. Use the zone for potential short trade entries
5. Invalidation: If price rises past the top of the bearish IFVG zone

## Key Differences from FVG
- FVGs are market imbalances formed by a three candle pattern
- First and third candle wicks fail to overlap the second candle's body in FVGs
- The range between the wicks highlights an FVG
- IFVGs form when FVGs are invalidated by either candle wick or close

## Trading Strategy
One of the most popular strategies using IFVGs involves liquidity grabs:
1. Wait for a liquidity grab
2. Look for IFVG formation
3. Enter position when IFVG forms (via candle wick or close)
4. Set stop loss below IFVG
5. Take profit at 1:2 risk-to-reward ratio

### Example Trade Setup
- Scenario: Bullish liquidity grab detected
- Action: Price moves up, invalidating bearish FVG
- Result: Forms bullish IFVG
- Entry: After IFVG formation
- Stop Loss: Below IFVG
- Take Profit: 1:2 risk-to-reward ratio

## Best Practices

### Timeframe Selection
- Works on all timeframes
- Suitable for various trading styles:
  - Scalping
  - Day trading
  - Swing trading
  - Investing
- Higher timeframes are generally more reliable
- Recommended to use multiple timeframes for better context

### Avoiding Bad Trades
1. Trade with confluence
2. Don't enter solely on IFVG retest
3. Look for additional confirmation:
   - Liquidity Grabs
   - Breaker Blocks
   - Market trend confirmation

## Trading Applications
1. Price Reversal Indication
2. Trade Entry Points
3. Profit Taking Areas
4. Trend Reversal Confirmation

## Common Mistakes
1. Trading without understanding FVGs first
2. Entering trades without confluence
3. Ignoring market context
4. Not waiting for proper invalidation
5. Missing stop loss placement
