# Breakaway Gap

## Introduction
A Breakaway Gap is a sophisticated trading concept utilized by price action traders (also known as SMC or ICT Traders). It represents a Fair Value Gap (FVG) that remains unmitigated, meaning price does not return to fill it. Understanding these gaps is crucial for traders to refine their strategies and make informed decisions.

## Definition
A Breakaway Gap occurs when a Fair Value Gap (FVG) remains unfilled, with price failing to return to the gap area. These gaps often indicate strong directional momentum and require understanding of related concepts:
- Breaker Blocks (BB)
- Inversion Fair Value Gaps (IFVG)
- Balanced Price Ranges (BPR)

## Pattern Recognition

### Bullish Breakaway Gap Identification
There are three scenarios that can transform a bullish FVG into a Breakaway Gap:

1. Breaker Block Formation:
   - Price moves higher
   - Closes above bearish Order Block (OB)
   - Forms bullish Breaker Block
   - BB acts as support on retracement

2. IFVG Formation:
   - Price moves higher
   - Closes above bearish FVG
   - Forms bullish IFVG
   - IFVG acts as support on retracement

3. BPR Formation:
   - Price moves higher
   - Forms another bullish FVG
   - Overlaps with bearish FVG
   - Creates BPR support zone

### Bearish Breakaway Gap Identification
There are three scenarios that can transform a bearish FVG into a Breakaway Gap:

1. Breaker Block Formation:
   - Price moves lower
   - Closes below bullish Order Block (OB)
   - Forms bearish Breaker Block
   - BB acts as resistance on retracement

2. IFVG Formation:
   - Price moves lower
   - Closes below bullish FVG
   - Forms bearish IFVG
   - IFVG acts as resistance on retracement

3. BPR Formation:
   - Price moves lower
   - Forms another bearish FVG
   - Overlaps with bullish FVG
   - Creates BPR resistance zone
